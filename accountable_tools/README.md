🚀 Overview
This is the frontend codebase for Accountable Tools, a business data management platform designed with flexibility, transparency, and automation in mind.

The frontend is built using Vite + React + Tailwind CSS, replacing the previous Next.js implementation.

Why Vite?
⚡ Faster development & builds (~10x faster than Next.js in some cases).
🎯 Simpler, more modular structure without opinionated routing.
🛠️ Easier debugging & direct control over performance optimizations.

🎯 Tech Stack
Framework: Vite with React
UI Library: Tailwind CSS for modern, accessible styling
State Management: Zustand or React Query (TBD)
Routing: React Router (instead of Next.js built-in routing)
Package Manager: npm (or pnpm if needed)
Linting & Formatting: ESLint + Prettier
Pre-commit Hooks: Husky + lint-staged
Deployment: Vercel (TBD) or Cloudflare Pages (TBD)
